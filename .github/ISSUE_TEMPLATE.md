# Issue Request 
Thank you for helping us identify issues with our Demo DApp.  We appreciate your help. We use issues for tracking features, bugs and discussions. Here is a guide on how to properly format your issues for clarity and legibility.


 ### Requirements
- [ ] First check that issue does not exist already
- [ ] Please name your issue.  The title should contain the ID.
- [ ] Determine priority (based on impact)
- [ ] Understand which repo to use, what label to tag issue with
- [ ] Platform used (OS version, browser version)
- [ ] Any detail that can help developer reproduce/troubleshoot is helpful: screenshot, short video, and any messages that show up in the browser console. More detail is always appreciated.

If you need help or have any questions, please ask in our **#qa-testing** channel in [our Discord](https://OriginProtocol.com/discord ). Thank you.
